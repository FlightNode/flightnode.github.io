*Just sketching in the dev environment for now...*

## Development Environment

Minimum environment:

* Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition
* SQL Server LocalDB

Suggested:

* Visual Studio Code for any HTML, CSS, JS work.

## Workspace Setup

* Fork your repositories off of the main repositories of FlightNode.
* Install Git & Git.commandline using Chocolatey. Prefer not to use Git through Visual Studio Community Edition. Visual Studio Code still has some reasonable GUI control for GitHub.
* Locally, create a directory called 'Workspaces' (or any name of your choice).
* In Windows explorer, right-click on 'Workspaces' and choose Git Bash. That will open the Unix-like bash prompt window, 
  with c:\Workspaces as the current working directory. Run these commands
  to create your local repositories (note - there will be more than these three in the future): 


    > mkdir FlightNode
    > cd FlightNode git clone https://github.com/*<username>*/FlightNode.Identity
    > cd FlightNode git clone https://github.com/*<username>*/FlightNode.Common
    > cd FlightNode git clone https://github.com/*<username>*/flightnode.github.io


* If you are new to GitHub, then here is a fun tutorial to get you started https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1

## Testing

* Unit Test: xUnit.Net. Suggest installing the Visual Studio runner.
* Mocking: Moq
* Desired code-coverage: 80%
  * VS Community does not have code coverage. Need to setup OpenCover.

## Front-End

* Angular.js
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Bootstrap (Angular version)

## Back-End

* API routing: WebApi
  * I strongly considered Node.js, PHP, and Python - but the reality
    is that finding hosting for Node.js and Python is expensive,
	and I hate PHP. Also, in recruiting for an open source team,
	I needed to target to the framework that my friends are already
	comfortable in.
* Hypermedia specification: Collection+JSON or HAL or Siren (undecided)
* DB: SQL Server 2014
* Auth: ASP.NET Identity Framework
* ORM: EntityFramework (tentative)
  * Considering NServiceKit.OrmLite or Dapper as alternatives.
  * Why use EF at all? Code migrations. And because it is a useful
    skill to have, even if there are much higher performing 
	frameworks
* Architecture: Onion


## Lifecycle Management

* Source Control: GitHub
* Artifacts: possibly post directly to NuGet, bower.
* Integration: AppVeyor (future)
* Deployment: AppVeyor (future)
